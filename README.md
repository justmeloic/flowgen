## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Use the Makefile for streamlined development and deployment:

```bash
# Development mode (run both services separately)
make dev

# Build frontend static files for production
make build
```

### Development Mode (Two Services)

For development with hot-reloading:

```bash
# Start development servers for both services
make dev
```

This runs:

- Frontend development server at `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API server at `http://localhost:8081`

### Production Mode (Single Service)

For production deployment, the frontend is built into static files and served by the backend:

```bash
# Build static frontend
make build

# The backend now serves both API and frontend at http://localhost:8081
```

## Session Management & Design Continuity

The Architecture Designer maintains design continuity throughout your architecture discovery process. The following diagram illustrates how design sessions are managed between the frontend and backend:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LocalStorage
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant DesignService

    %% Initial Design Request without Session ID
    Client->>Frontend: Start architecture design
    Frontend->>LocalStorage: Check for existing sessionId
    alt No existing session
        Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/v1/root_agent (no X-Session-ID header)
        Backend->>DesignService: Create new design session
        Backend-->>Frontend: Response with new X-Session-ID header
        Frontend->>LocalStorage: Store sessionId
    else Has existing session
        LocalStorage-->>Frontend: Return stored sessionId
        Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/v1/root_agent (with X-Session-ID header)
        Backend->>DesignService: Validate & use existing session
        Backend-->>Frontend: Response with same X-Session-ID
    end

    %% Subsequent Design Iterations
    Note over Client,DesignService: Design Refinement Requests
    Client->>Frontend: Refine architecture requirements
    Frontend->>LocalStorage: Get stored sessionId
    LocalStorage-->>Frontend: Return sessionId
    Frontend->>Backend: POST with X-Session-ID header
    Backend->>DesignService: Get existing design session
    DesignService-->>Backend: Return session with design context
    Backend-->>Frontend: Response with refined architecture
```

The design session management flow works as follows:

1. **Initial Design Session**:

   - If no session exists, the frontend makes a request without a session ID
   - The backend generates a new UUID and creates a new design session
   - The session ID is returned in the X-Session-ID header
   - The frontend stores this ID in localStorage

2. **Design Iteration Requests**:

   - The frontend retrieves the session ID from localStorage
   - All requests include the X-Session-ID header with design context
   - The backend validates and uses the existing session
   - The same session ID is returned in responses

3. **Design State Management**:
   - The backend maintains design state using ADK's InMemorySessionService
   - Each session tracks requirements, constraints, and architectural decisions
   - Design context persists across multiple refinement iterations
   - Sessions maintain conversation history for context-aware improvements

This stateful approach ensures design continuity and context preservation across multiple interactions, allowing for iterative architecture refinement.

## File Upload for Architecture Context

The Architecture Designer supports file uploads to provide additional context for your system design. Files are processed immediately and their content is made available to the AI agent to inform architecture decisions.

### Supported File Types

- **Architecture Documents**: PDF, Markdown, Plain text
- **Existing Diagrams**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP (for reference)
- **Requirements**: JSON, CSV (structured requirements)
- **Code Samples**: Python, JavaScript, Java, etc. (for understanding existing systems)
- **Configuration Files**: YAML, JSON, XML (infrastructure configs)

### How It Works

1. **Unified Processing**: Files and requirements are sent together to `/api/v1/root_agent/`
2. **Context Integration**: Files are validated, stored as artifacts, and processed upon upload
3. **Architecture Awareness**: File content is analyzed and integrated into the design process
4. **Memory Storage**: Uses ADK's `InMemoryArtifactService` for efficient temporary storage

### Usage in Architecture Design

1. Click the attachment button (üìé) in the chat input
2. Select relevant files (up to 10MB each, 5 files max)
3. Describe your architecture requirements
4. The agent receives both your requirements and file content as context

### Example Enhanced Architecture Process

When you upload a requirements document with the message "Design a microservices architecture for this system", the agent receives:

```
User: "Design a microservices architecture for this system"

[Files uploaded with this message:]
File: system-requirements.pdf
Document analysis:
- Functional Requirements: User management, payment processing, inventory
- Non-functional: 1M+ users, 99.9% uptime, PCI compliance
- Constraints: 6-month timeline, AWS only, existing PostgreSQL
```

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: File validation, artifact storage, architecture-aware content processing
- **Frontend**: File attachment component with drag & drop (planned)
- **Storage**: In-memory artifacts (temporary, cleared on restart)
- **Processing**: Architecture-focused processors for optimal design context extraction

### Security

- MIME type validation with magic byte verification
- File size limits (10MB default)
- Basic malicious content detection
- Sandboxed file processing for architecture documents

## Deployment

### Architecture Overview

The system uses a unified deployment model:

1. **Static Build**: Frontend is pre-rendered into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. **Single Service**: FastAPI backend serves both API endpoints and static frontend files
3. **Simplified Operations**: Only one deployable unit with Python runtime requirement

### Deployment Process

```bash
# Build static frontend for production
make build

# The backend service now contains the frontend and serves everything at port 8081
```

**Final deployment requirements:**

- Python 3.13+ runtime
- Single service deployment
- Frontend assets mounted in backend at build time

### Why This Architecture?

**Benefits:**

- **Resource Efficiency**: Single service reduces memory and CPU overhead
- **Simplified Networking**: No cross-service communication needed
- **Easier Operations**: One process to deploy, monitor, and manage
- **Port Management**: Only one port to expose and configure

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Two services (`make dev`) for faster iteration with hot-reloading
- **Production**: Single service (`make build`) for optimized deployment
