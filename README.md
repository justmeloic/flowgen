## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

FlowGen is built using a **distributed monolith** architecture, which offers the benefits of both monolithic and microservices architectures. This means the application is structured as a single deployable unit, but internally, it's composed of distinct, loosely coupled services that communicate with each other.

**Components:**

1.  **Web UI (Frontend):**
    - Provides the user interface for interacting with FlowGen.
    - Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui.
    - Handles user input, file uploads, and real-time rendering of diagrams.
2.  **Mermaid Service (Backend):**
    - The core AI-powered engine that processes user input and generates Mermaid diagrams.
    - Built with Python, FastAPI, and Google's Gemini AI model.
    - Responsible for understanding natural language, extracting system structure, and generating Mermaid code.
3.  **Communication**
    - the front end communicate with the backend through a REST API.
4.  **Static File Server:**
    - Serves the static files for the web UI.
    - Integrated within the FastAPI application.
5.  **Mermaid library:** \* Used to render the mermaid diagram in the front end.
    **Benefits:**

- **Simplicity:** Easier to develop, deploy, and manage compared to a complex microservices architecture.
- **Performance:** Efficient communication between components due to being part of the same deployment unit.
- **Scalability:** Individual components can still be scaled separately if needed.
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

```bash
cd services/mermaid
pytest
```

Run frontend tests:
```bash
cd services/webui
npm test
```

## üì¶ Deployment

FlowGen follows a distributed monolith architecture pattern, where the application is deployed as a single unit but maintains clear internal service boundaries. The build process compiles the Next.js frontend into static files that are served by the FastAPI backend, creating an efficient and easily deployable package.

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Compiled to static files during build
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Serves both the API and static files
- **Deployment Model**: Single deployable unit with internal service separation

### Deployment Options

FlowGen provides three deployment methods using the `build-deploy.sh` script:

1. **Local Development** (`--local`)
   ```bash
   ./build-deploy.sh --local
   ```
   # or
   ```bash
   ./build-deploy.sh  # default option
   ```
   - Builds Next.js frontend into static files
   - Copies built files to FastAPI's static directory
   - Starts FastAPI server in development mode
   - Best for local development and testing

2. **Docker Compose** (`--docker`)
   ```bash
   ./build-deploy.sh --docker
   ```
   - Builds and runs the application using Docker Compose
   - Creates isolated environment with all dependencies
   - Suitable for development and testing in containerized environment
   - Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems

3. **Cloud Run Deployment** (`--cloud`)
   ```bash
   ./build-deploy.sh --cloud
   ```
   - Builds and deploys to Google Cloud Run
   - Requires proper GCP setup and permissions
   - Provides scalable, serverless deployment

### Cloud Run Deployment Prerequisites

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:
   ```properties
   PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   REGION=your-region
   REPO_NAME=flowgen-repo
   SERVICE_NAME=flowgen-service
   IMAGE_NAME=flowgen
   IMAGE_TAG=latest
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

2. Set up service account permissions by running:
   ```bash
   ./service-account-permissions.sh
   ```
   This script grants necessary permissions for:
   - Artifact Registry access
   - Cloud Run deployment
   - Service account usage

3. Ensure you have:
   - Google Cloud CLI installed and configured
   - Docker installed and running
   - Authentication configured for Artifact Registry

### Build Process

The build process follows these steps:

1. **Frontend Build**
   - Compiles Next.js application
   - Optimizes assets
   - Generates static files

2. **Integration**
   - Copies static files to FastAPI's static directory
   - Configures serving paths

3. **Deployment**
   - Packages everything into a single deployable unit
   - Deploys according to chosen method

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Local and Docker deployments can be monitored through standard logs
- Cloud Run deployments can be monitored through Google Cloud Console
- Logs are available through Cloud Logging when deployed to Cloud Run
