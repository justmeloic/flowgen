"""Middleware for managing user session IDs via HTTP headers.

This module provides a Starlette/FastAPI middleware that intercepts requests
to API paths, retrieves or generates a session ID, and makes session data
available to downstream application logic via the request state. It also
ensures the session ID is returned in the response headers.
